Git and GitHub
10/10/14

Hi all. 

This is William Tsang. My Chinese name is Kaawang, hence, the username kaawang.

I'm currently enrolled in Dev Bootcamp and I am learning a ton of things and its only the first week! I'd like to share a few of those things with you.

What are the benefits of version control?
Version control is surprisingly useful. Imagine writing a college essay that has a 25 page requirement. You first start off with a rough draft. Which is the bare backbone of your paper. It contains the bones but not the meat. Your second draft should contain a little more meat to accompany the structure of the paper. Lastly, your third draft should have all of the examples and analysis coherently expressed with the point you are trying to state. This is version control!

How does git help you keep track of changes?
Git will allow you to manage your changes and check if there are differences between the original and the modified files. There are a series of commands paired with git; add, remove, push, pull, fetch, merge and etc. 

git add -> adds the modified file to commit list
git remove -> removes the modified file from the commit list
git commit -> commits the modified files in the commit list 
git push -> pushes the modified files in the commited list to the GitHub repository
git pull -> grabs data and changes from GitHub repository

This allows you to manage your work with GitHub. 

Why use GitHub to store your code?
You should use GitHub to store your code in the event you want to share your code with others. Other developers/programmers can also clone your files and help you with coding as well! Another reason why you should use GitHub is that you can treat it as a storage server that contains the master copy of your code. Once you finish coding a function and you are happy with it, you can push it to GitHub in which it will merge the modified file with the original file.
